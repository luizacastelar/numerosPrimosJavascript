"Code challenge *
Goals: 1. Finds all the prime numbers between 1 and 1000. 2. Sums all the prime numbers that you found between 1 and 1000. 3. 
The `main` function should return the sum of all prime numbers. Develop the solution entirely on this editor.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 etc are prime numbers. 
4 for example, is not a prime number since 4 is divisible by 2. 4 / 2 = 2. Bonus points for a more functional approach in your code. 
For example, try to use array functions such as map, filter or reduce."
